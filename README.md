# Footie Friends ‚öΩÔ∏è:

## Description:

Footie Friends is a platform designed to help parents organise and join local football meet-ups for children aged 7-12, with a strong emphasis on child safety. The platform allows parents to easily find and create football events, giving them peace of mind knowing that all coaches are DBS certified and first aid trained. The website is currently designed in the perspective of our user 'Jane' and her daughter 'Janey'.

## Why We Created Footie Friends:

Many parents struggle to find safe, organised local activities that offer physical exercise, social interaction, and community engagement for their children. Based on user research, we identified pain points and developed Footie Friends to address them.

## How We Tackled the Challenges:

- Event Filtering: By location, date, time, and age, allowing parents to find suitable events for their schedule and child's age group.
- Certified Coaches: All coaches are DBS checked and first aid trained, providing assurance for parents.

## Features üéØ:

- Home Page: Displays a list of local football events.
- Event Filtering: Filter events by location, date, time, and age to find the perfect fit.
- Join Event Button: Allows parents to sign their children up for the chosen event.
- Create Event Page: Parents can organise a football meet-up, add it to the platform‚Äôs database, and have it displayed on the homepage for others to join.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è:

- Next.js: Offering reusable components, easy routing, and server-side rendering to improve performance.
- PostgreSQL: Managing relational data like events and attendees.
- Render: Used for reliable and scalable deployment.
- GitHub Actions: Implemented a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and ensure smooth development processes.
- Linting & Formatting: Integrated into our workflow to maintain code quality and consistency across the team.
